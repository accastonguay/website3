# About me

I'm a PhD candidate at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. My current work consists of developing a model to simulate the uptake of nature-based solutions for stormwater treatment and harvesting in cities. The simulations are carried out with an agent-based model that aims to reproduce decision-making and interactions of the main actors in the urban water management system. The model is developed within [DynamMind toolbox](http://iut-ibk.github.io/DynaMind-ToolBox/) and also uses results from [UrbanBEATS](http://urbanbeatsmodel.com/) simulations. 

For my MSc thesis at Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany, I looked into the ecosystem services, resilience and adaptive capacity of communities making a living from rice terraces in Banaue, in the Philippines.

I'm also big fan of everything related to R!
